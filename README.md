The Serial CAN Bus module provides your Arduino with CAN Bus capabilities and allows you to hack your vehicle. It lets you to read and write messages to the CAN Bus. The Serial CAN Bus module can be connected to your Arduino through the on-board Grove connector.

CAN Bus is a messaging protocol system that lets various microcontrollers and sensors within a vehicle to talk to each other. CAN provides long distance, medium communication speed, and high reliability.

The Serial CAN Bus module is based on MCP2515 CAN controller and MCP2551 CAN transceiver provides speed up to 1Mb/s. It also has a terminal block so you can connect to your vehicleâ€™s OBD-II port with two wires.
